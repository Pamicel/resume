  <p>Compagnie 359 Degrés — Freelance — Paris, France</p>
  <p>The play <em>La Grande Suite</em> is an in-person interactive experience tailored to the spectator’s choices and
    profile. To achieve this level of personalisation, we designed two apps that are integral parts of the play. Using one
    app, to-be spectators fill out forms and immerse themselves in the universe of the play. Using the second app, actors
    and playwrights manage groups and get useful statistics. After delivering the app, we started focusing our attention
    on hardware devices such as a fake telephone, wearable lights and a wearable remote.</p>

  <p>We created this project with friends while in software engineering school. We set up this group to showcase
    interactive Art installations in different settings and we had varying implications in the making of the artworks form
    helping the artist to fine-tune their creations, to co-creating the artworks. This was a collaboration with the French
    Ministry of Culture’s General Direction of Art Creation (DGCA, Direction Générale de la Création Artistique).</p>

  <p>With a strong focus on collaboration, independance, continuous learning (learning how to learn, learn by doing), the
    school has a very good reputation in the French tech scene. It is free, admission is infamously difficult, based on
    the candidate&#39;s rate of progress during a month long bootcamp called the <em>Piscine</em>. The school financed and
    spearheaded by French billionaire (and most famous computer nerd) Xavier Niel.</p>
