## Experience

### Nov 2019 → ongoing | Full Stack Web Developer, Technical Expert, Digital Artist

Compagnie 359 Degrés — Freelance — Paris, France

The play _La Grande Suite_ is an in-person interactive experience tailored to the spectator’s choices and profile. To achieve this level of personalisation, we designed two apps that are integral parts of the play. Using one app, to-be spectators fill out forms and immerse themselves in the universe of the play. Using the second app, actors and playwrights manage groups and get useful statistics. After delivering the app, we started focusing our attention on hardware devices such as a fake telephone, wearable lights and a wearable remote.

#### Achievements with Compagnie 359 Degrés

- Product development strategy from proof of concept (Wix + Google Sheet scripts) to prototype/MVP (Vue + NodeJS served with Nginx on an Ubuntu 20.04 through Digital Ocean + SQLite database) to full fledged app (Vue + NestJS in typescript + PostgreSQL, same server)
- Cross-discipline communication and problem solving
- Zero to hero in NestJS and Typescript

### May 2019 → June 2020 | Front end developer

Owkin — Permanent — Paris, France

Product maker in a Machine Learning company.

Owkin is a MedTec startup focused on using the potential of Machine Learning for finding insights on rare diseases and cancer. The product I worked on was an app aimed at making it easier for researchers and data scientists to work together efficiently despite their very different skill sets and methodologies.

#### Achievements at Owkin

- Zero to hero in ReactJS
- Took part in setting up the Agile development methodologies
- Collaborated with data scientists and machine learning specialists

### Feb 2017 → June 2018 | Co-founder and technical lead

Bonjour Capsule — Independant — Paris, France

We created this project with friends while in software engineering school. We set up this group to showcase interactive Art installations in different settings and we had varying implications in the making of the artworks form helping the artist to fine-tune their creations, to co-creating the artworks. This was a collaboration with the French Ministry of Culture’s General Direction of Art Creation (DGCA, Direction Générale de la Création Artistique).

### Achievements within Bonjour Capsule

- Collaborated closely with artists on artworks that involved software or electronics
- Developed the website for the project using Vue and Node
- Zero to hero in Javascript, NodeJS, MongoDB and VueJS
- Managed a team of 12 volunteer software engineering students
- Many successful last minute debugs (software and hardware)

## Education

### 2016 → 2019 | School 42 | Software architecture

With a strong focus on collaboration, independance, continuous learning (learning how to learn, learn by doing), the school has a very good reputation in the French tech scene. It is free, admission is infamously difficult, based on the candidate's rate of progress during a month long bootcamp called the _Piscine_. The school financed and spearheaded by French billionaire (and most famous computer nerd) Xavier Niel.

### 2014 → 2016 | Université Rennes 2 | Physics and robotics

Bachelors in Physics, robotics and mechanics. I did not finish this bachelors degree due to the fact that my new-found passion for coding quickly absorbed my attention.

## Personal bullet points

- I love architecture and Art history
- Nothing has ever made me happier than sailing
- I enjoy meticulous work
